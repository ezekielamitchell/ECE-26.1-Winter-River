# Monitoring Equipment — `monitoring_a` / `monitoring_b`

## Real-World Role

Data center infrastructure management (DCIM) systems, building management systems (BMS), environmental sensors, CCTV, and network management platforms all require reliable 120V AC power from a utility-derived step-down transformer. These systems must remain operational even during partial power events because they provide the visibility operators need to diagnose and respond to failures in real time. Many facilities place monitoring equipment on a dedicated small UPS or a separate branch of the main UPS to ensure maximum uptime. Loss of monitoring is itself a declared incident in Tier III/IV operations — operators working without instrumentation during an outage face unacceptable safety and recovery risk.

## States

| State    | Meaning                                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `NORMAL` | Powered — all monitoring systems operating              |
| `ALERT`  | Powered, but one or more monitoring alerts are active   |
| `FAULT`  | Overvoltage (> 145V) or other electrical anomaly        |
| `OFF`    | No input power (< 100V) — monitoring systems dark       |

## Quick Test

```bash
# Subscribe to live telemetry
mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.4.1 -t "winter-river/monitoring_a/status" -v

# Simulate power loss to monitoring (triggers OFF)
mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.4.1 -t "winter-river/monitoring_a/control" -m "INPUT:0"

# Raise a monitoring alert
mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.4.1 -t "winter-river/monitoring_a/control" -m "STATUS:ALERT"

# Restore normal monitoring
mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.4.1 -t "winter-river/monitoring_a/control" -m "INPUT:120 STATUS:NORMAL"
